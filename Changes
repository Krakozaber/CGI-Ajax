.28 2005-09-07 10:14:54 Wed, 07 Sep 2005
  the user can now send in static parameters on the function call:
  the fnargs has been renamed to 'args'
  the user can use a parameter as :
  onclick=(['args__1234','div'],['result'])
  which will form the url  &args=1234&args=valueindiv
  can also rename parameters via:
  onclick=(['parname__'+getVal('div')],['result'])
  which will for the url:   &parname=valueindiv
  this is useful for sending to outside scripts which may not use 'args'
    as the cgi parameter name.
  renamed getElem to getVal



.32 2005-09-08 14:49:29 Thu, 08 Sep 2005
  the url will now be appended to
  so if get parameters are on the initial url, they can be used in the
  registered ajax function
  Lot's of documentation and some code restructures.

.49 2005-09-29 08:36:37 -0700 Thu, 29 Sep 2005
  Fixed broken fnsplit so it wouldn't split strings.  Restructured
  javascript code for spaces and indents.  Need to give Brent my
  vimrc to prevent real tab chars from coming through.  Removed
  all tab chars and replaced with spaces.  Made lots of changes
  to pjx_combo.pl to better document and organize the html layout.

.52 2005-10-05 11:14:27 -0700 Wed, 05 Oct 2005

  Complete rewrite of POD documentation and expansion of documentation.
  Added heretofore undocumented capability of sending POST instead of
  the default GET.

.55 2005-10-07 09:33:28 -0700 Fri, 07 Oct 2005

  Can now chain functions; ajax[] array holds pjx objects, so pjx
  objects don't keep overwriting themselves.
  Cleaned up javascript custom function code.

.56 2005-10-07 10:35:33 -0700 Fri, 07 Oct 2005

  Changed debugging output for javascript to show multiple URLs is
  there are chained commands.
  Fixed a bug introduced in .55 that broke IE browsers - IE doesn't
  support onload, so switched back to onreadystatechange.

  Added radio to scripts directory;
  Added ability to handle radios;

    of the correct xmlhttp/activeX request object
  Changed name of 'radio.pl' to 'pjx_radio.pl'
  Version to .58

.59 2005-10-10 09:35:49 -0700 Mon, 10 Oct 2005

  Version incremented to .59.  Modified Changes and MANIFEST.  Modified
    output of pjx_radio.pl.
  fix docs in pjx_radio

  encoding '='.  Problem was parens were mislocated.

.591
    fixed .59 bug that didn't fix the encodeURIComponent bug

.60 2005-10-17 12:45:31 -0700 Mon, 17 Oct 2005
  Fixed problem with javascript in make_function() where sep variable
  was getting overwritten if the processed url contained a '?'.
  Thanks to pavfed98 for identifying this - reported via rt.cpan.org.

  Added scripts/pjx_url.pl and scripts/convert_degrees.pl to scripts.
  These were needed to properly test the make_function handling of
  outside URLs (related to above bug).

  Added support to pass in additional information to build_html()
  function that gets sent directly to the cgi objects header() call.
  This allows for custom HTML header information to get sent to the
  pages generated in the CGI::Ajax system.  Thanks to Jesper Dalberg
  for suggesting this.

  Modifiedcorrected docs.

  Updated to version 0.60

.64 2005-10-27 09:45 -0700 Thu, 27 Oct 2005
  Fixed cross-site scripting vulnerability identified in the <=0.60
  versions.  All users of CGI::Ajax should upgrade asap!  If a browser
  submits a request for a CGI::Ajax page that contains a function that
  doesn't exist, a status 400 Bad Request is returned.  Additionally,
  STDERR gets some output about this event with a "SECURITY" tag, just
  in case.  Thanks to krusch for catching this!

  Changed how CGI extra header parameters are passed into the CGI
  object.  Now all parameters destined to CGI->header() are added as a
  hashref to the CGI::Ajax->build_html() method, like this for example

  $pjx->build_html( $cgi, \&Show_HTML, {-charset=>'UTF-8'} );

  Any pre-0.64 CGI::Ajax script that passed in extra header
  information to the CGI object will be updating.

  Modified/corrected docs to explain the above change.

  Fixed up javascript code to make all loop variables local.  Thanks
  to Mingyi Lui.

.641 2005-10-27 12:54 -0700 Thu, 27 Oct 2005
  Pod documentations fixups.

  Changed fnsplit to better support multiple selects (thanks Mingyi
  Lui)

------------------------------------------------------------------------
.65 2005-10-27 12:55 -0700 Thu, 27 Oct 2005

  pod typo corrections

  changed javascript fnsplit to better support multiple-selects styles

  add pjx_callback.pl to demonstrate the use of a callback function.
  this required a fix in the Ajax.pm code 

  Fixed up synopsis example POD.

.651 2005-11-02 07:32 -0800 Wed, 02 Nov 2005

  added support for hidden fields.

.652 2005-11-03 13:41 -0800 

  fixed type in javascript for handling hidden fields!

  updated version and Changes to reflect .652 release

.653 | bcthomas | 2005-11-14 18:42:42

  moved some debugging code around so perl can handle the jdebug
  state.  Thanks beanz!

  Added a script (pjx_nobuild.pl) to demonstrate not using
  build_html() but to instead handle the various stages of 
  the async communication manually.

  Fixed up POD

.654 | bcthomas | 2005-11-15 10:38:55

  Added fix for redundant js if test back in.  Thanks again beanz

  Updated MANIFEST to show new no build_html() script and incremented
  version to 0.654

0.66 | bcthomas | 2005-11-29 10:22
  
  POD cleanup/corrections

  Added support for other CGI handlers/decoders (like CGI::Simple,
  CGI::Lite, CGI::Minimal, although we can't really test them since we
  are running mod_perl2 only here.

  Fixed typo in pjx_url.pl/convert_degrees.pl that was reversing the
  sign on the kelvin degree conversion (thanks Wolfgang Baron!)

  Switched home page URL to www.perljax.us

  Updated version to 0.66

0.662 | bcthomas | 2005-12-01 12:15
  
  POD cleanup/corrections

  Added a example script to show proper way to use a javascript
  function to split arguments returned from a perl-exported function.
  scripts/pjx_splitargs.pl

  Updated version to 0.662

0.67 | bcthomas | 2005-12-01 16:29

  reversed quick fix for javascript handling return values from perl
  functions added in 0.662.

  now multiple returns to a callback function are handled as
  arguments[0], arguments[1], etc. uses an eval in the javascript
  code, the way it was described in the POD, but wasn't coded.

  changed splitargs.pl: added value="" to <input>'s getting the
  return values from the function call to stop weird javascript
  warning

  Updated to 0.67
