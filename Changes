  the user can now send in static parameters on the function call:
  the fnargs has been renamed to 'args'
  the user can use a parameter as :
  onclick=(['args__1234','div'],['result'])
  which will form the url  &args=1234&args=valueindiv
  can also rename parameters via:
  onclick=(['parname__'+getVal('div')],['result'])
  which will for the url:   &parname=valueindiv
  this is useful for sending to outside scripts which may not use 'args'
    as the cgi parameter name.
